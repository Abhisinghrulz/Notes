Benefits of using proxy server
* Cache : Which can serve a lot of requests
* It can coordinate requests from multiple servers &  can be used to optimize request traffic.
* It collapse requests for data that is spatially close together in the storage, which we'll decrease request latency.
* Proxies are useful under high load situations or when we have limited caching
* Provides anonymity and may be used to bypass Ip address blocking.
